                    <p class="bio-1">Howdy! My name is William Hockaday (they/she/he), but my students call me Teacher Hock. Students can rely on me for direct, targeted feedback that helps them improve at every stage of their learning. At Georgetown University, I worked in the Writing Center, assisting over 165 clients with brainstorming, drafting, revising, and refining their writing—always emphasizing growth beyond simply earning a grade.</p>

                    <p class="bio-2">I am deeply committed to supporting students and ensuring that learning is inclusive and accessible. My teaching philosophy centers on providing opportunities for every student to succeed, grow, and take ownership of their education. By prioritizing curiosity, engagement, and personalized support, I aim to empower students to reach their full potential.</p>

                    <p class="bio-3">Currently, I work as a secondary ELA educator in the DMV area, with experience supporting students in both general and special education classrooms. I design lessons that engage students and foster meaningful discussion, helping them develop the skills to think critically and independently. My experience has shown that learning thrives when content is both challenging and accessible to all students.</p>

                    <h2>Emphasize the Whole of a Person</h2>
                    <p>Learning is not just an academic endeavor, but a deeply human interaction where emotions, values, identities, and relationships hold utmost importance. When schools see students only through the narrow lens of test scores and assessments, they risk neglecting the social, emotional, and creative aspects that make each kid so unique. By honoring the whole person, we foster room for growth and safe exploration.</p>

                    <h2>Provide a Platform</h2>
                    <p>Ensuring that students have a platform to voice their opinions, thoughts, and criticisms is essential for creating independent thinkers and scholars. A platform fosters self-esteem, agency, and the sense that their perspectives matter. Authentically listening to the voices of each student in the room allows their contributions to shape the learning environment, cultivating dialogue that is more inclusive and transformative.</p>

                    <h2>Leverage Student Knowledge</h2>
                    <p>Student knowledge and experiences are often overlooked with the way we currently treat teachers as the masters of knowledge. However, when we leverage what kids know, we transform learning into a collaborative process where the teacher becomes a facilitator rather than a gatekeeper. Drawing on students’ contextual knowledge makes lessons more relevant and engaging, allowing new concepts to connect with what is already familiar and meaningful.</p>

                    <p>The DMV is currently under occupation, people are stolen in broad daylight, and heartache fills headlines both from afar and at home. Despair seems to be the most logical and easy option; however, it is crucial that we lead with care and emphasize the needs of those most affected by these daunting times. Knowing that even the smallest acts of kindness can spark a hope to carry us forward, walk down the path with care, compassion, and courage.</p>
